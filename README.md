# Python Inventory Activity

## Problem Description

Create an inventory program using the following data structures:

* A **list** to store item names
* A **dictionary** to store the corresponding item prices

The program should allow the user to:

1. **Add a new item**

   * Ask for the item name
   * Ask for the price
   * Add it to both the list and dictionary
   * Prevent duplicate item names

2. **Update the price of an existing item**

   * Ask for the item name
   * If it exists, update its price
   * If it doesn't exist, show an error message

Use loops and conditionals for the menu.

Do **NOT** include deleting items or out-of-stock features.
